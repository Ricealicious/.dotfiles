While this is meant as a guide for my future self, it feels almost more like a time capsule of sorts.

Note that PopOS uses a gnome desktop environment.

## Installation

The installer is not yet complete.

1. Navigate the terminal to the installer file.
2. Input `chmod +x Installer.sh`
3. Input `./installer.sh`
