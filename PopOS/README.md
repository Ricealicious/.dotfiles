# PopOS dotfiles

While this is meant as a guide for my future self, it feels almost more like a presentation of my current knowledge to my future self. I am sure it is possible to create some script that installs everything from my .dotfiles while also creating [Symbolic Links](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/symlink-tutorial-in-linux-how-to-create-and-remove-a-symbolic-link/) but, admittedly, I had only just learned what symbolic links are.

Note that PopOS has a gnome desktop environment.

## Installation

1. Navigate the terminal to the installer file.
2. Input `chmod +x Installer.sh`
3. Input `./Installer.sh`
