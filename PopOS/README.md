# Installation

While this is meant as a guide for my future self, it feels almost more like a presentation of my current knowledge to my future self. I am sure it is possible to create some script that install everything from my .dotfiles while also creating [Symbolic Links](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/symlink-tutorial-in-linux-how-to-create-and-remove-a-symbolic-link/) but, admittedly, I had only just learned what symbolic links are.

## Dependencies

Currently, there are no dependencies.

## Placement of files

I am sure that this seems rather amateurish, but this is the best that I can do currently.

| dotfile    | Placement   |
| :--------: | :---------: |
| .gitconfig | /home/user/ |
| .ssh       | /home/user/ |
| .themes    | /home/user/ |
